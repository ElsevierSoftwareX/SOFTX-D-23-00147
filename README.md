# EODIE - Earth Observation Data Information Extractor 

## Purpose 

EODIE is a toolkit ot extract object based timeseries information from Sentinel-2 Earth Observation data.

The goal of EODIE is to ease the extraction of time series information at object level. Today, vast amounts of 
Earth Observation data are available to the users via for example earth explorer or scihub. Often, not the whole images 
are needed for exploitation, but only the timeseries of a certain feature on object level. Objects may be polygons depicting 
agricultural field parcels, forest plots, or areas of a certain land cover type.

EODIE takes the objects in as polygons in a shapefile as well as the timeframe of interest and the features (eg vegetation indices) 
to be extracted. The output is a per polygon timeseries of the selected features over the timeframe of interest.
